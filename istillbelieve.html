        <p>I Still Believe is a 2020 American Christian romantic drama film directed by the Erwin Brothers and starring KJ Apa, Britt    Robertson, Shania Twain, Melissa Roxburgh and Gary Sinise. It is based on the life of American contemporary Christian        music singer-songwriter Jeremy Camp and his first wife, Melissa Lynn Henning-Camp, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer      shortly before they married. Camp's song "I Still Believe" is the film's namesake.</p>
        <p>The film is the first production by Kingdom Story Company, the Erwin Brothers' fifth feature film, and their second to be    released under the Lionsgate banner. It premiered at ArcLight Hollywood on March 7, 2020, and was theatrically released in    the United States on March 13, 2020.</p>               
        <p>Based on Camp's memoir of the same title, it focuses on Camp's romance with his first wife, Melissa, whom he married in      October 2000 despite knowing she was dying. The couple were informed after their honeymoon that Melissa's cancer had          spread. She died in February 2001, 4Â½ months after they married.
